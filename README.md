Title: The Effect of Riparian Vegetative Growth on the Nitrogen Content of Interfacing Surface Water

Hypothesis Description: Our hypothesis involves the relationship between riparian vegetation density (RVD) and nitrogen content/concentration of surface water. Specifically, whether or not increases in riparian vegetation yeild measurable differences in runoff limitation and therefore measurable influences in the nitrogen concentrations of bodies of water in proximity to the respective riparian zone. We hypothesize that: if a riparian zone of a given area has a greater surface area/density of vegetation, then the less runoff-depositing of nutrients (nitrogen) nearby bodies of water will experience such that concentrations of nitrogen in those surface waters will be lower. 

Data Description: 

The data that we plan to use to test our hypothesis is sourced from three unique aquatic NEON field sites (namely, LeConte Creek, TN [LECO], Blue River, OK [BLUE], and Upper Big Creek, CA [BIGC]) across two different years (2019 and 2021). More specifically, we've drawn from a total of four different data products. Two products (NEON_comp-struct-riparian and NEON_cover-veg-riparian) contain information on the vegetative cover and composition of riparian zones within each site, and the other two (NEON_nitrate-surfacewater and NEON_chem-surfacewater) contain measures of the nitrate concentration and, more generally, the chemical analyte concentrations (including a broader range of nitrogenous compounds) of surface water in riparian zones. Using the densiometer data and class-assorted coverage measurements of the former two, paired with the nitrate and broader nitrogenous analyte concentrations measured in the latter two, we can begin to determine whether or not there is a relationship between riparian vegetative density/coverage and the the nitrogen content of interfacing surface water.
