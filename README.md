Title: The Effect of Riparian Vegetation Growth on the Nitrogen Content of Interfacing Surface Water

Hypothesis Description: Our research experiment seeks to determine the relationship between riparian vegetation density (RVD) and the nitrogen content/concentration of surface water. More specifically, we're interested in determining whether or not increases in riparian vegetation yield measurable differences in runoff limitation and, therefore, significantly influence the nitrogen concentrations of bodies of water in proximity to the respective riparian zones. We hypothesize that: if a given riparian zone has a greater surface area/density of vegetation, it will (subsequent of the additional root structure) be less susceptible to nutrient-depositing runoff and, therefore, deposit less soil nutrients (including nitrogen) into nearby bodies of water, resulting in lower concentrations of nitrogen in those surface waters. We intend to test this hypothesis by comparing riparian zones located in three different aquatic NEON field sites across multiple years. By analyzing data sheets that, through densiometer readings and class-assorted coverage surveys, outlines the vegetative composition of predetermined riparian zones in contingency with chemical assays (containing concentrations of nitrates and other nitrogenous compounds) of the surface water interfacing with each riparian zone, we hope to determine whether or not a relational pattern emerges between denser surveyed riparian zones and the nitrogen concentrations of the surface water therein.

Data Description: The data that we plan to use to test our hypothesis is sourced from three unique aquatic NEON field sites (namely, LeConte Creek, TN [LECO], Blue River, OK [BLUE], and Upper Big Creek, CA [BIGC]) across two different years (2019 and 2021). More specifically, we've drawn from a total of four different data products. Two products (NEON_comp-struct-riparian and NEON_cover-veg-riparian) contain information on the vegetative cover and composition of riparian zones within each site, and the other two (NEON_nitrate-surfacewater and NEON_chem-surfacewater) contain measures of the nitrate concentration and, more generally, the chemical analyte concentrations (including a broader range of nitrogenous compounds) of surface water in riparian zones. Using the densiometer data and class-assorted coverage measurements of the former two, paired with the nitrate and broader nitrogenous analyte concentrations measured in the latter two, we can begin to determine whether or not there is a relationship between riparian vegetative density/coverage and the the nitrogen content of interfacing surface water.
